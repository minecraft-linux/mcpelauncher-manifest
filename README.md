## Versions 1.20.30+ will not have hardware rendering on older hardware (GLES 3.0 is now required)

Read Issue https://github.com/minecraft-linux/mcpelauncher-manifest/issues/933 to force software rendering to be able to run them anyway

For mesa3d this would be defining `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` to `1` of the launcher process. Alternatively you can replace your libEGl drivers with <https://github.com/google/angle/> and tell it to use the swiftshader backend.
